# Cubo

<p>This is a simple .NET Core app that allows users to "organize" items into buckets.  I created this during the "Modern Web Development with ASP.NET Core" course (https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-path-modern-web-development-with-aspnet-core)</p>
<p>The functionality is very basic, but really loved the concepts I was learning here.  It definitely helped me get up close and personal with .NET Core.</p>
